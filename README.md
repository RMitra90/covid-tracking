# COVID-19 Tracking : USA

This is a simple Shiny web app to visualize the COVID-19 cases in the United States of America. It is deployed using RStudio's hosting service. The dashboard was updated regularly until March 7, 2021. 

As of March 7, 2021 I am no longer updating the dashboard with new data. 

Data Source: [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/)
